 InGen_Soda_Machine
A console program used as a database front end to manage the inventory and profits of a soda vending machine.

This, like Viper Science, is used both practically and as a learning aid. This program was originally written 
in C++ using three files. But when I needed to learn how to use SQL I redesigned it to be a database front end.

As to the name 'InGen', I just like the name. the program has nothing to do with International Genetic Technologies 
or Jurassic Park.
